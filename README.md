🚀 Overview

SmartOffice Orchestrator is an AI-powered multi-agent automation system built using IBM watsonx Orchestrate.
It connects multiple enterprise tools, automates repetitive office work, and collaborates with users through natural language.

This project demonstrates how multiple agents and low-code workflows can boost productivity in HR, IT, scheduling, and task management.

🎯 Key Features

🔹 1. Multi-Agent Collaboration

The system intelligently calls different agents to complete tasks:

🔹 3. Natural Language Interaction

Users can ask:

> “Create a meeting with the team tomorrow.”
“Update the manager assignment.”
“Add a new task in Salesforce.”



The orchestrator selects the correct agent and executes the task.
